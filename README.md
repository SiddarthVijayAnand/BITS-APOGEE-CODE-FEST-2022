# BITS-APOGEE-CODE-FEST-2022
Hi I am Siddarth Vijay Anand.
This is my landscape art using Python Turtle for the BITS Pilani APOGEE Junior Code Fest 2022.

Story  Behind the landscape:

The Evening is a landscape made using Python Turtle. I am an avid photographer myself. I love taking photos of the pink sky in the evening. I love the sky, as whenever I ever have a problem, when I see the sky I get a solution. Also, you never see the same clouds twice. I was inspired by one of my own photos that I took when I was 7 and we went on a trip to Shimla. It was my first ever cloudscape, but now, after 8 more years, I have over 60 cloudscapes and 50 landscape photos. So, as a tribute to the original cloudscape I took, I have made this python landscape.
